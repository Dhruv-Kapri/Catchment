# Decision log

Newest first. One entry per decision: what was decided, why, and what it rules out. Big or
hard-to-reverse decisions also get an ADR in `docs/adr/` (created when the first one is needed).

## 2026-10-28: Initial scope

- **The core is a planning tool, not an ops simulator.** The user is a network planner deciding where
  stores go; the simulator (dispatch, batching, routing) is a later stage that stress-tests a plan.
- **First area: Gurugram + South Delhi.** Mixes a dense old city with high-rise sectors, so the
  trade-offs show; small enough to iterate fast. All of NCR is a later scaling stage.
- **Open data only; competitors are synthetic.** OSM and Overture barely have dark stores (5 and 11
  named features in the NCR box, see [data-sources.md](data-sources.md)); Google Places content can't
  be stored; scraping operator apps breaks their terms.
- **Demand is a transparent model**, not a forecast: population × affluence proxy × capture share,
  scaled to publicly reported orders per store per day. No ML forecasting without real order data
  to validate it against.
- **Travel times: OSRM two-wheeler profile, precomputed**, with a congestion multiplier as a lever and
  a hand spot-check of ~20 routes whose error is reported. OSRM is not hosted.
- **Plans are solved on request** (FastAPI + CP-SAT, ≤ 10 s), not precomputed, because changing a
  lever and getting a new plan is the product.
- **Benchmark against a greedy baseline** in the first cut; the arXiv 2312.11494 heuristic moves to
  Later (time budget, see [cuts.md](cuts.md)).
